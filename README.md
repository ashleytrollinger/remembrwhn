# RemembrWhn
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Introduction/ Motivation
RemembrWhn is a website hope to be mobile app that allows users to store their memories in a meaningful way. I wanted to create something along the lines of snapchat memories because that is the only feature that keeps me on the app, however with memories you have access to all of them at any time. I wanted this platform to be more intentional and more about the specific user than the social aspects snapchat offers. In turn, a virtual time capsule idea was born and created. While there are still many marks I would like to hit in future development of the application (photo saving, shared capsules, location based capsules) this first deployed MVP has been completely created by yours truly, from the UI graphics being created in Figma to the backend structure hosted through supabase. This is my first personal passion project and I am really happy with where it is at the moment.
